## What I learned from this homework
* Using bootstrap to make all the website page easily good looking in same style of consept
* How important to make relative layout
* Front end work is so fun!

## What I learned from this update
* Very surprised me conpare to first time I made this page, all the html, css code writing became more natural to me.
It is very fun to work on front-end, easy to see the result, easy to see the problem.
Also made me really excited to see own portfolio page that I am on the way to become web developer..
However, I am looking forward to work on more back-end from next week.
